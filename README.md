# Scientific-Calculator-App-Tkinter-

A helpful scientific calculator app that can calculate logarithmic, trigonometric, and several algaebraic expression. Like most general scientific calculators,
it is able to error-handle any input errors or evaluation errors such that the calculator program would not crash and lose memory of the previously held answer.
To run the application, simply run the main_calculator_program.py, and the tkinter application window should open. Hopefully this calculator is useful and 
brings you some good marks!
